===============

This the full* source code to [davidmoreen.com](http://davidmoreen.com).

* minus `slider.js`. `slider.js` is needed for the slider, as seen on the home page, to work. I do not have the license to this file. However, you may buy a copy [here](http://codecanyon.net/item/ddslider-10-transitions-inline-content-support/104797)


Installation
------------

Installing the code is super simple.

Follow these steps:

- Download source code
- Copy contents to your web server
- Run `schema.sql` in your MySQL database
- Rename `config/config.example.php` and `config/db/connect.example.php` to `config/config.php` and `connect.php` respectively
- Edit those two files to reflect your own data and database connection information
- Done
